I had an idea for a platform that would host interesting dialogues—inspired by the comment sections of Moneyweb.com. It may or may not be created in the coming years. The platform's manifesto summarises my current state of mind and somewhat explains why I created this repository. I could've opted for a more concise reason for creating the repository, but the manifesto is more interesting. See below:

The platform is simple-looking and robust, reflecting its vision: simple yet robust dialogue. The topics discussed will range, but I favour the platform as a space for economic and political discussions. It is not intended to be another subreddit or newsletter comment section but rather a digital wall—carefully pinned to it is the discourse of South Africans. I envisage the topics and subsequent dialogues to be controversial yet enlightening. As both a nation and a society, we are witnessing the disintegration of civics, moral fiber, and most importantly, neighbourly love. However, there is little that can exacerbate this decline more than our failure to emancipate ourselves from the ever-increasing moral laxity through text and thought. I am no moralist, no philosopher, and certainly not flawless; I am simply a man who loves his nation. The goal is beauty through discourse—the result: enlightenment. Ideate, share, ideate again, and share once more. For we will be better through this glorious cycle.

Happy chatting.
